# Overview

This is a Recipe Organizer that I built to help my wife keep track of all the recipes she likes to use. She is a food science major and always trying out new things so I built her an app to keep track of her recipes.

# Development Environment

I used Xcode to develope the project and an Iphone simulator to make sure everything looks right and runs well.

I used SwiftUI to write this. I originally used Ukit, but decided SwiftUI would make the project easier so I switched over.
